# Constellation

_Constellation_ is a dynamic, interactive visual 'mesh' graphic done purely in JavaScript.

[Live demo found here.](http://exp.v-os.ca/constellation)

`constellation.js` in `/module` acts as the condensed file.

Nearly all elements of the graphic are parameterized, and easily modifiable. For parameter control, simply modify the documented parameters in the beginning of the `module` file.

The canvas will be automatically resized to its parent's size.
